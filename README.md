Adventures-in-Python
====================

A collection of ultra-basic Python modules to track my learning experience.

A friend and I are using friendly competition to measure our progress while learning the language,
with an endgoal of having practical, hands-on knowledge in both Python and the Django framework.

Each competition is overseen by a neutral third-party programmer friend, who grades module functionality, 
syntax, and efficiency.
